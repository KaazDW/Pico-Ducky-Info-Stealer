# BadUSB - System Information Exfiltration via Discord

## üìã Description
This project implements a BadUSB tool using a Raspberry Pi Pico to exfiltrate sensitive information from a Windows computer and send it to a Discord webhook. The project includes two versions of a PowerShell script: a detailed version and a lightweight version.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `info_stealer_detailed.ps1`: Full version of the script that collects detailed system information
- `info_stealer_lite.ps1`: Lightweight version for faster and more discreet execution
- `payload.dd`: Command to execute to launch the PowerShell script

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Preparation**:
   - Copy your chosen PowerShell script (`info_stealer_detailed.ps1` or `info_stealer_lite.ps1`) to the Pico's USB drive
   - Rename it to `pico_computer_info_discord.ps1`
   - Create a `payloads` folder at the root of the USB drive if needed
   - Configure your Discord webhook in the PowerShell script

2. **Execution**:
   - Plug the Raspberry Pi Pico into the target computer
   - The script will run automatically and send the information to the configured Discord webhook
   - Cleans up execution traces
